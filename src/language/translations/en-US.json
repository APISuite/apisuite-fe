This token can be used in the requests so the API can verify your identity. The following POST request is an example of how you may get the token depending on your setup. Replace the variables with the Client ID and Client Secret of one of your Apps.\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST \\\\\n-H \"Host: gateway.address\" \\\\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\\\n-u \"{ClientID}:{ClientSecret}\" \\\\\n--data-urlencode \"grant_type=client_credentials\" \\\\\nhttps://gateway.address/oauth2/token\n```\n\n## Step 3: Make a request to the API\n\nNow with the `apikey` added to the header you can make a request to GET or POST data.\n\n### POST\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST \\\\\n-H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\n-H \"apikey: APIKEY_VALUE\" \\\\\n-d '{\"name\": \"Jack Daniels\", \"desc\": \"My cat\", \"tag\": \"cat\"}' \\\\\nhttps://gateway.address/v1/pets\n```\n\n### GET\n\n```shell\ncurl -X GET \\\\\n-H \"apikey: APIKEY_VALUE\" \\\\\nhttps://gateway.address/v1/pets\n```\n"
